    <p>How To Cook Chicken Breast in the Pan 
    Let’s first focus on how to cook a chicken breast in the pan, which is my favorite technique because of the flavorful crust that forms. Chicken breasts must be at room temperature before going in the pan as cold chicken can cook unevenly and tends to be tough. Allow the chicken breast to sit out for 20 minutes. That should do the trick. </p>
